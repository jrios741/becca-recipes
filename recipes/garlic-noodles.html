    <h1>Garlic Noodles</h1>
    <p>One of Becca's favorite foods to get is thai food, specifically<br>
        that of Richmond's My Bar and Noodle restaurant. Usually, she<br>
        gets some kind of curry or duck related menu item.<br>
        But at home, Becca makes these noodles, which in my opinion, are<br>
        than anything I can get there.
